hrdns is shortcut from h(etzner)r(obot)dns. I chosen shorter version because of possible license/trademark issues.
Hetzner.de provides great hosting services in western europe. As their client, I wanted to automate some
parts of our(me & my current company) infrastracture.
This tool covers dns-management in Hetzner's Robot panel.
